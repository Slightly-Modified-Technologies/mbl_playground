# THe HTML CSS JS Playground

I will add all the projects using just HTML CSS and Javascript here 1 by 1 :)

I Will come back and make this read me link to each project and be a cool readme.

## Note

We have stopped after doing all the projects up to the playground mashup, I don't know if we want that one in here it's more of a website than a component. It has pages aand other HTML page stuff. We also didn't do the typescript w/ express as that was following along and just getting TS -> Express for an API we built.

### TODO

- GO Through and take images and add them to each components read me :) also add some links to each branch here.
