# SideNavigation Component

WE have created a nice side nav with hamburger and closing icon, we created the nav items but we still have work to do on it. it's a nice custom lite weight sidenav.

## ToDo

- TODO: 1: Update nav to be on right side and anime r2l VS left side anime l2r
- TODO: 2: Convert css -> scss
- TODO: 3: IF: not move sidenav to right, maybe just move the hamburger close icon!
- TODO: 4: Make the nav items dynamic! js: NAV_ITEMS: [{t:"",d,"",...}]
